- **Embedding**: `![alt text](path)` on its own line renders inline as an
  image, video, or audio player, chosen automatically from the file
  extension (video: mp4/webm/ogv/mov/m4v; audio: mp3/wav/ogg/oga/m4a/flac/
  aac; anything else: image). A small chevron in the editor gutter next to
  that line collapses/expands the embed (remembered per note on your
  device).
- **Adding files**: drag a file from the OS onto the editor, paste a file
  from your clipboard (e.g. a screenshot), or use the toolbar's **Insert
  media or file** button. The file is copied into the vault-level `files/`
  folder under a cleaned-up name (with a short suffix if that name is
  taken), and a `![Name](/files/file.ext)`
  (media) or `[Name](/files/file.ext)` (other files) line is inserted at
  your cursor. The link is the same wherever the note later moves.
- **Paths**: a path starting with `/` resolves from the vault root; any
  other relative path resolves against the note's own folder (you can't
  reach outside the vault with `../../`). `file:` URLs are rejected.
  `data:` URIs render directly.
- **Remote images**: `http(s)://` image URLs only render if you've turned
  on **"Render external images in this note"** in the
  [Attributes panel](/guide/attributes/#attributes-panel) — off by default, per note.
- **Cleanup**: if you delete an embed line (or the note itself), Mahfouz
  removes the underlying file from disk automatically, but only if no
  other note in the vault still references it. Only files under `files/`
  (or, for older vaults, beside the note) are ever removed this way.
- **Markdown export** copies the note (and, optionally, its children) plus
  the attachments they reference, keeping `/files/…` links valid with the
  export folder as the root.
- **Link titles**: after pasting a bare URL, press **Tab** while the
  "Tab → title" hint is showing to fetch the page's title and turn it into
  a normal Markdown link (`[Title](url)`).
